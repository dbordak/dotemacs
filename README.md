I'm Silly
=========

And so is this repo. I know nothing about elisp so this is probably going to be
really bad for a while. If I had to guess, it'll probably get a ton of plugins
before I decide I need to go all minimalistic and stuff, then switch to a
10-line init.el. Or maybe I won't. Who knows.

All this is worsened by the fact that these are someone else's configuration
files. I'm probably going to break everything at least once before I'm happy.

Original Readme follows. Except for the URL change down there.
