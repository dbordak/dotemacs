I'm Silly
=========

And so is this repo. I know nothing about elisp so this is probably going to be
really bad for a while. If I had to guess, it'll probably get a ton of plugins
before I decide I need to go all minimalistic and stuff, then switch to a
10-line init.el. Or maybe I won't. Who knows.

Original Readme follows.
